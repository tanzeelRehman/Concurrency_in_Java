A JAVA 8 lambda is  basically a function in java without decleration usually written as (parameter)-> {body}

EXAMPLE:

(int x, int y) -> x+y
(int x, int y) -> {return x+y;}

x -> x*x
() -> x

1. A lambda can have 0 or more parameters seperated by commas and their type can be explicitly decleared or       inferred from the context

2. Parenthesis are not needed around a single parameter

3. () is used to denote zero parameters

4. The body can contain zero or more statments

5. Braces are not needed around a single statment body
